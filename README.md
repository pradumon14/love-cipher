## 💌 Example Love Letter

### ✏️ Original Message

```
To the one who unknowingly became the constant in my life,

They say love can fade with time — but mine grows, endlessly.  
My love for you is like e^x — it doesn’t matter whether you integrate me into your life or differentiate me away from it, I will remain the same.  
Actually, not just the same... it grows, exponentially.

Every glance from you is like a derivative — sharp, precise, and impossible to ignore.  
And every word you say — a summation of everything beautiful this world holds.  

I don’t need a function to describe how I feel — you already complete the equation of my heart.  
No limits, no discontinuities — just a smooth, infinite curve of affection.

Forever growing,  
— Your constant.
```

## 🧠 How It Works

This project uses a **Caesar cipher**, also known as **ROT cipher**, where each letter is shifted by a fixed number (1 to 25). It preserves:

- Uppercase & lowercase characters
- Punctuation marks (.,!?)
- Emojis 😍 ❤️ 🥰
- Whitespace and formatting

---

## ❤️ Use Cases

- Sending encrypted messages to your crush 😘
- Hidden Valentine's notes 💌
- Just-for-fun terminal games 💻
- Learning basic cryptography 🔐
